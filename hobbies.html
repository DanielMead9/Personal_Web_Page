      <p>
        I played Hockey for 12 years of my life. Hockey is defintely my favorite
        sport and pass time. I am a die hard bruins fan. I watch every game
        every season for the Bruins. I am also a baseball fan. I don't watch the
        red soxs as much as I watch the bruins, but defintely still pay attenion
        to how they are doing.
