          West Boylston is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United
          States and a northern suburb of Worcester. The population was 7,877 at
          the 2020 census. West Boylston includes the village of Oakdale,
          located on the opposite side of the Wachusett Reservoir from West
          Boylston center along Route 140. Although the town was split off from
          Boylston, it has a larger population than its eastern namesake. West
          Boylston was originally part of several neighboring townsâ€”Lancaster,
          Shrewsbury, Boylston, Holden and Sterling. The town was created as
          part of a dispute between Boylston and West Boylston over the location
          of a new town meeting house. The town was officially incorporated in
          1808.
